<!-- Scenario 1 -->

<!-- Legal Concerns -->
<!-- They may be breaking GDPR laws if they are sharing the customers data with the payday loan company without the customers knowledge or consent. -->

<!-- EthicalConcerns -->
<!-- marketing to customers that are struggling financially with payday loans can be seen as taking advantage of them/ a predatory practice -->

<!-- How can the company address the issue/s -->
<!-- Obtain consent from customers to share their data with 3rd party companies.
BankingCorp can also try and find more ethical alternatives for third party companies to share customer data with. For example financial help services for the customers who are struggling financially rather than payday loan companies. -->


<!-- Scenario 2 -->

<!-- This company is most likely not breaking any laws but their may be some ethical concerns with their proposal. -->

<!-- ethical concerns -->
<!-- This proposal could be seen as potentially encouraging addictive behaviours amongst the player base. By exploiting the players desire to progress faster you could end up with a situation where you have made more vulnerable players such as addicts and minnors become addicted to spending money on hints. -->

<!-- How can the company address the issue/s -->
<!-- by providing more payment free routes to earning more hints the company can mitigate the addictive effects of purchasing hints. -->
<!-- The company can also set in place strict age restricitons and age verification to ensure that any underage and impressionable minors arent able to purchase the potentailly addictive hints in excess. This can be done via daily purchase limits or custom parental controls for under 18s. -->

<!-- Scenario 3 -->

<!-- Legal concerns -->
<!-- A legal concerns here is the sharing of user data. This must follow GDPPR regulations -->
<!-- another potential legal concern here is the content of the advertisemnts as advertsing laws around targetted advertisements must be met -->

<!-- ethical concerns -->
<!-- Locking some of the existing features behind a paywall may raise ethical concerns as it may spread feelings of unfairness,discontent and inequality amognst users. -->
<!-- there is also the ethical concern of sharing customers locations with a vast amount of people. This could be seen as an invasion of privacy. -->

<!-- How can the company address the issue/s -->
<!--  The company could aquire explicit consent from customers to share their location with other customers and they could also allow customers ot set how specific their location information that is shared is. They could also get consent to use this location data for advertising from the customers.-->
<!-- The company could alleviate the concerns of introducing a paywall by ensuring that rather than removing the essential features from the free tier ,and therefore negatively impacting the experience of these free tier customers, they could add new and enchancing features to the preimium tier so that all customers feel that they are being provided with a good service regardless of what tier they are in.-->
